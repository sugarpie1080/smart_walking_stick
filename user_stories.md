## Must Haves

### Obstacle Detection

As a visually impaired user, I want the walking stick to detect obstacles in my path in a timely fashion so that I can navigate safely without collisions.

### Status Monitor
As a user, I want a way to check if the walking stick is powered on and working so that I know it is functioning before I start walking.

As a developer, I want the status monitor to alert me if something is malfunctioning (e.g., sensor failure) so that I can troubleshoot.


### Haptic Feedback
As a visually impaired user, I want the walking stick to vibrate when an obstacle is detected so that I get immediate tactile feedback without needing to check a screen.

As a user, I want different vibration strengths depending on how close an obstacle is so that I can gauge distance more accurately.


### Drop Mode

As a user, I want the walking stick to detect if I drop it so that it can alert me.
